# Pygame Raytracer

Yes it's possible! Made as a freshman project in college using pygame for windowing, as a way to understand the theory behind a raytracer.

## YouTube
A video example can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugao07K2RVs

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)

## Running
To run simply install pygame and run main.py with python3. I'm guessing just about any python3 version will work, but it is untested.

It should work on any platform supported by pygame (tested on Windows and Ubuntu 20.04)
